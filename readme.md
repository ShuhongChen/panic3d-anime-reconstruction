*We propose PAniC-3D, a system to reconstruct stylized 3D character heads directly from illustrated (p)ortraits of (ani)me (c)haracters.  Our anime-style domain poses unique challenges to single-view reconstruction; compared to natural images of human heads, character portrait illustrations have hair and accessories with more complex and diverse geometry, and are shaded with non-photorealistic contour lines.  In addition, there is a lack of both 3D model and portrait illustration data suitable to train and evaluate this ambiguous stylized reconstruction task.  Facing these challenges, our proposed PAniC-3D architecture crosses the illustration-to-3D domain gap with a line-filling model, and represents sophisticated geometries with a volumetric radiance field.  We train our system with two large new datasets (11.2k Vroid 3D models, 1k Vtuber portrait illustrations), and evaluate on a novel AnimeRecon benchmark of illustration-to-3D pairs.  PAniC-3D significantly outperforms baseline methods, and provides data to establish the task of stylized reconstruction from portrait illustrations.*

A talking head demo is available in the project's [drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zpt9x_OlGALi-o-TdvBPzUPcvTc7zpuV?usp=share_link).  We extend PAniC-3D to provide a 3D talking head from a single portrait illustration.  The mesh is extracted with normals through marching cubes, and we manually place two bones with linear blend skinning (this maybe automated with [RigNet](https://zhan-xu.github.io/rig-net/), etc.).  Instead of making texture maps, we render the positions and normals of intersections, which are then used as rays to query our radiance field.  In order to perform expression changes, we incorporate [talking-head-anime-2](https://github.com/pkhungurn/talking-head-anime-2-demo) to change the texture.


## download

![](./supplementary/schematic.png)

Download the `panic_data_models_merged.zip` from the project's [drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zpt9x_OlGALi-o-TdvBPzUPcvTc7zpuV?usp=share_link), and merge it with this repo's file structure.

There are several repos related to this work, roughly laid out according to the above schematic; please follow instructions in each to download

* A) [panic3d-anime-reconstruction](https://github.com/ShuhongChen/panic3d-anime-reconstruction) (this repo): reconstruction models
* B) [vtubers-dataset](https://github.com/ShuhongChen/vtubers-dataset): download 2D data
* C) [vroid-dataset](https://github.com/ShuhongChen/vroid-dataset): download 3D data
* D) [animerecon-benchmark](https://github.com/ShuhongChen/animerecon-benchmark): download 2D-3D paired evaluation dataset
* C+D) [vroid_renderer](https://github.com/ShuhongChen/vroid_renderer): convert and render 3D models

All the repos add to `./_data/lustrous` and share its file structure; we recommend making a folder on a large drive, then symlinking it as `./_data/lustrous` in each repo


## setup

Make a copy of `./_env/machine_config.bashrc.template` to `./_env/machine_config.bashrc`, and set `$PROJECT_DN` to the absolute path of this repository folder.  The other variables are optional.

This project requires docker with a GPU.  Run these lines from the project directory to pull the image and enter a container; note these are bash scripts inside the `./make` folder, not `make` commands.  Alternatively, you can build the docker image yourself.

    make/docker_pull
    make/shell_docker
    # OR
    make/docker_build
    make/shell_docker


## evaluation

Run this line to reproduce the best-result metrics from our paper.  There might be minor hardware variations and randomness in rendering; below are results from two different machines.

## training

The training script is at `./_train/eg3dc/runs/ecrutileE_eclustrousC_n120/ecrutileE_eclustrousC_n120.sh`, which contains the command and hyperparameters used for our best model
